Random Meal Generator
This is a simple, single-page web application that helps you decide what to eat by generating a random meal suggestion with the click of a button. It is a great example of a beginner-friendly project that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a quick and interactive solution for a common problem: indecisiveness about what to eat. It also serves as an excellent educational tool for learning how to build a basic web page with client-side scripting.

Features
Interactive Button: A simple button that triggers the meal generation.

Randomized Output: Provides a different meal suggestion each time you click the button.

Clean Interface: Uses basic HTML and CSS to present a clean, easy-to-use interface.

Usage
To run this application, you only need to open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

This project relies on the following files to function correctly:

index.html: The main structure of the web page.

resources/js/main.js: Contains the JavaScript code that handles the meal generation logic.

resources/css/index.css: Provides the styling for the page.

Notes
Adaptability: The main.js file can be easily edited to include your own list of meals, making it a personalized tool.

Learning: This project is perfect for new developers looking to practice working with the Document Object Model (DOM), handling user events, and using arrays in JavaScript.
